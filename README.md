### Content Flow Demo

The goal of this demo is to identify the steps needed for vertical sizing to flow from the individual elements all the way up the node hierarchy.
The current demo illustrates the problem, most specifically around viewBlocks wrappers not inheriting the height of their wrapped content even when inner content has explicit size defined.

Current behavior:
- Tab view (viewBlock wrapped node) does not allow interaction with tabs. Tabs are only clickable if height is explicitly set on the ProfileTabs class.
- Vertical Scrolling doesn't allow scrolling all the way to the bottom of the wrapped tab view.
- Tab view doesn't expand horizontally to device rotation.

Expected behavior:
- Vertical scrolling should allow scrolling to the bottom of the Tab View. The scrolling area should be different depending on the selected tab. "First Controller" has a height of 600pt and "Second Controller" has a height of 400pt
