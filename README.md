### Content Flow Demo

The goal of this demo is to identify the steps needed for vertical sizing to flow from the individual elements all the way up the node hierarchy.
The current demo illustrates the problem, most specifically around viewBlocks wrappers not inheriting the height of their wrapped content even when inner content has explicit size defined.
